            <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
            <p>
              Chadwick Aaron Boseman was born and raised in Anderson, South
              Carolina to Carolyn and Leroy Boseman, both African-American. His
              mother was a nurse and his father worked at a textile factory,
              managing an upholstery business as well. According to Boseman, DNA
              testing indicated that some of his ancestors were Krio people from
              Sierra Leone, Yoruba people from Nigeria and Limba people from
              Sierra Leone. He graduated from T. L. Hanna High School in 1995.
              In his junior year, he wrote his first play, Crossroads, and
              staged it at the school after a classmate was shot and killed.
              <br />
              <br />
              Boseman attended college at Howard University in Washington, D.C.,
              graduating in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in directing. One
              of his teachers Phylicia Rashad, helped raise funds, notably from
              her friend and prominent actor Denzel Washington, so that Boseman
              and some classmates could attend the Oxford Mid-Summer Program of
              the British American Drama Academy in London. After he returned to
              the U.S., he graduated from New York City's Digital Film Academy.
              He lived in Brooklyn at the start of his career. He worked as the
              drama instructor in the Schomburg Junior Scholars Program, housed
              at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem,
              New York.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 2008, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career.
              Boseman began dating singer Taylor Simone Ledward in 2015. The two
              reportedly got engaged by October 2019. Boseman was raised a
              Christian and also was part of a church choir and youth group.
              <br />
              <br />
              Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, which
              eventually progressed to stage IV before 2020. He had never spoken
              publicly about his cancer diagnosis. During treatment, involving
              multiple surgeries and chemotherapy, he continued to work and
              completed production for several films, including Marshall, Da 5
              Bloods, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, and others. Boseman died at his
              home as a result of complications related to colon cancer on
              August 28, 2020, with his wife and family by his side.
